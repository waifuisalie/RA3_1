## Defense Strategy

### Before the Defense (1 Week)

**Day 1-2**: Foundation
- Review all 4 existing theory files (`01_attribute_grammars_theory.md` through `04_advanced_exercises.md`)
- Read `05_defense_quick_reference.md` - print and keep with you

**Day 3-4**: Practice
- Work through `06_manual_derivation_cookbook.md` - practice each recipe 3 times
- Complete `07_proof_templates.md` - fill in all blank templates

**Day 5-6**: Simulation
- Answer all 40 questions in `08_defense_question_bank.md`
- Review `09_common_traps_and_mistakes.md` - avoid these errors!

**Day 7**: Final Prep
- Re-read `05_defense_quick_reference.md`
- Review `10_implementation_reference.md` - know where each rule lives in code
- Practice whiteboard derivations with team

### During the Defense (2-5 Minutes)

**Step 1: Listen Carefully** (10 seconds)
- Identify question type: Type inference? Symbol table? Control structure?
- Reference mental map from quick reference

**Step 2: Structure Your Answer** (30 seconds)
- Start with: "I'll demonstrate this step-by-step using formal notation"
- State what you'll prove: "I'll show that expression X has type T"

**Step 3: Execute** (2-4 minutes)
- Follow cookbook recipe for that question type
- Use clear notation: Γ ⊢ e : T
- Explain as you write

**Step 4: Conclude** (30 seconds)
- Summarize: "Therefore, the expression has type T because..."
- Connect to implementation if asked: "This is implemented in file X, lines Y-Z"

## Quick Lookup: Question Type → Resource

| If Professor Asks... | Use This File | Go To Section |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| "Prove type T for expression" | 06_cookbook | Recipe 1 or 2 |
| "Why is this an error?" | 09_traps | Find matching error |
| "Show IFELSE derivation" | 06_cookbook | Recipe 3 |
| "What's the symbol table?" | 06_cookbook | Recipe 4 |
| "Where in code is this?" | 10_implementation | Search by rule name |
| "What operators accept real?" | 05_quick_ref | Operator table |
| "Why do / and + differ?" | 05_quick_ref | Permissive vs Strict |

---

## Team Preparation Strategy

### Option 1: Divide and Conquer
- **Member 1**: Master type inference (Category A) - become expert on arithmetic operators
- **Member 2**: Master error detection (Category B) - know all common mistakes
- **Member 3**: Master control structures (Category C) - IFELSE, FOR, WHILE expert
- **Member 4**: Master symbol table (Category D) - Γ evolution specialist

### Option 2: Everyone Learns Everything
- All team members practice all 40 questions
- Randomly quiz each other
- Time each answer (must be under 5 minutes)

**Recommendation**: Combination approach
- Everyone masters Quick Reference (universal knowledge)
- Each member specializes in 1-2 categories
- Cross-train on others

## Day-of-Defense Checklist

### Materials to Bring
- [ ] Printed copy of `05_defense_quick_reference.md`
- [ ] Whiteboard markers (if available)
- [ ] Confidence and calm demeanor

### Mental Preparation
- [ ] Reviewed quick reference this morning
- [ ] Practiced 5 sample derivations

## Critical Concepts to Memorize

### The "Rule of 22"
Your semantic analyzer has **22 semantic rules**:
- 7 arithmetic (including division types and power)
- 6 comparison (all return boolean)
- 3 logical (with truthiness)
- 3 control (IFELSE, FOR, WHILE)
- 3 memory (MEM_STORE, MEM_LOAD, RES)

### The "STRICT vs PERMISSIVE" Distinction
- **STRICT operators** (only int/int): `/`, `%`
- **PERMISSIVE operators** (any numeric): `+`, `-`, `*`, `|`
- **SPECIAL operator**: `^` (base flexible, exponent int only)

### The "Three Type Conversions"
1. **Promotion**: int → real (via promover_tipo)
2. **Truthiness**: numeric → boolean (via para_booleano)
3. **No conversion**: boolean → numeric (NOT ALLOWED for MEM)

### The "IFELSE Compatibility Rule"
- Branches MUST be compatible
- Use promover_tipo() to check
- If promover_tipo returns None → ERROR
- If promover_tipo returns type T → IFELSE : T

## Time Management During Defense

| Activity | Time Budget | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Understanding question | 10-15 sec | Listen carefully, identify type |
| Planning answer | 15-30 sec | Choose cookbook recipe |
| Drawing derivation | 2-3 min | Write clearly, explain as you go |
| Explaining code link | 30-60 sec | "This is in tipos.py line 214" |
| Handling follow-up | 30-60 sec | Be prepared for "why?" questions |

**Total**: 3.5-5.5 minutes per question

---

## Common Professor Follow-Ups

After your initial answer, expect:

1. **"Where in the code is this implemented?"**
   - Use `10_implementation_reference.md`
   - Answer format: "In src/RA3/functions/python/[file].py, lines X-Y, function [name]()"

2. **"Why did you choose this approach?"**
   - Refer to `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`
   - Explain architectural decisions (like seqs_map optimization)

3. **"What if I change operand 1 to type X?"**
   - Use Quick Reference to check compatibility
   - Reapply type rules with new assumption

4. **"Show me a case where this would fail"**
   - Use Common Traps guide
   - Provide concrete error example

## Red Flags to Avoid

### DON'T:
- ❌ Guess or make up rules ("I think it returns real because...")
- ❌ Say "I'm not sure" without trying
- ❌ Mix up `/` (int only) and `|` (any numeric)
- ❌ Forget to check initialization before variable use
- ❌ Say IFELSE branches can be any type (they must be compatible!)
- ❌ Claim boolean can be stored in MEM (it can't!)
- ❌ Rush - slow and correct beats fast and wrong

### DO:
- ✓ Use formal notation: Γ ⊢ e : T
- ✓ Show your work step-by-step
- ✓ Explain reasoning: "This is int because it's a literal without decimal point"
- ✓ Reference implementation: "This is checked in tipos.py"
- ✓ Draw clear derivation trees
- ✓ Ask for clarification if question is ambiguous

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Type Inference
**Professor**: "Prove that (5 3.5 +) has type real"
**Your Answer**: "I'll demonstrate step-by-step:
1. First, 5 is an integer literal (no decimal) → Γ ⊢ 5 : int
2. Second, 3.5 is a real literal (has .5) → Γ ⊢ 3.5 : real
3. Addition + is PERMISSIVE, accepts any numeric types
4. We apply promover_tipo(int, real) = real
5. Therefore: Γ ⊢ (5 3.5 +) : real [draws derivation tree]
This is implemented in tipos.py, promover_tipo function, which follows the int < real hierarchy."

**Time**: 2 minutes

### Scenario 2: Error Detection
**Professor**: "Why does (10 3.0 /) cause an error?"
**Your Answer**: "The error occurs because division / is STRICT:
1. It only accepts int/int operands (checked by tipos_compativeis_divisao_inteira)
2. Here, 10 is int but 3.0 is real (has decimal point)
3. The compatibility check returns FALSE
4. No matching semantic rule exists for DIV-INT with real operand
5. Error message: 'Operador / requer operandos inteiros'
The correct operator for real division is | (pipe), which accepts any numeric types."

**Time**: 90 seconds

### Scenario 3: IFELSE Branches
**Professor**: "Can IFELSE have branches of types int and boolean?"
**Your Answer**: "No, that would be a semantic error:
1. IFELSE requires compatible branch types
2. Compatibility is checked via promover_tipo(tipo_then, tipo_else)
3. promover_tipo(int, boolean) returns None (incompatible)
4. int and boolean have no common promoted type
5. Error: 'Branches de IFELSE incompatíveis'
Valid examples: int+real → real, int+int → int.
This is enforced in analisador_memoria_controle.py in the IFELSE validation."

**Time**: 2 minutes

## Emergency Strategies

### If You Blank Out
1. **Buy time**: "Let me work through this systematically..."
2. **Start with basics**: Draw Γ ⊢ e : T notation
3. **Use Quick Reference**: Pull out printed cheat sheet (if allowed)
4. **Think aloud**: "First, I need to identify the operand types..."
5. **Partial credit**: Even incomplete answers show understanding

### If You Make a Mistake
1. **Catch it**: "Wait, I need to correct that..."
2. **Fix it**: Show the right derivation
3. **Explain**: "I initially said X, but actually Y because..."
4. **Don't panic**: Corrections show you're thinking critically

### If Asked Something Unexpected
1. **Clarify**: "Do you mean [interpretation]?"
2. **Relate to known**: "This is similar to [familiar concept]"
3. **Admit gaps**: "I'm not certain, but my reasoning would be..."
4. **Offer to look up**: "I can find the exact implementation detail in the code"
